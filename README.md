# Volume of 3d mesh
### Calculate the volume of a closed triangle mesh in lightwave

I programmed this lscript to calculate the volume of any closed triangulated 3d mesh & display the volume in litres. Seems to work correctly but I can't guarantee the accuracy, at least not for complex shapes. It does however give correct results on simple geometry... And probably on complex shapes to. Based on math found here:
